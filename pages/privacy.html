        services include: Google apps, sites and devices, such as Search, YouTube and Google Home Platforms such as the Chrome
        browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, such as ads and
        embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign
        up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content such as emails and photos, or to see more relevant
        search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all;
        for example, searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using
        Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect
        and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory
        videos and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.</p>

        can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google
        Account, you might choose to provide us with information – like an email address to receive updates about our services.
        We also collect the content that you create, upload or receive from others when using our services. This includes
        things such as email you write and receive, photos and videos that you save, docs and spreadsheets you create and
